# Reference for Project Implementation

  The scene that we are aiming to create is inspired by the change of lighting and shadow shown by the video below:

  <video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="./assets/Final Project Overview/overview.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

  As you can see, the transition from daytime to nighttime will result in a gradual shift in the lighting conditions, affecting surrounding object's shadow and illumination. 

# Optional Features

  The following features are planned for implementation, but will only be prioritized if there is sufficient time within the project schedule:

  1. Implementation of wind
     -  A button that will create a wind effect that affects surrounding objects
  2. Flashlight button
     - A button that turns user's mouse into a light source that will interact with surrounding objects
