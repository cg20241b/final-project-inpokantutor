# Idea Concept
Inspired by an amazing scenery animation or picture. Our team take an idea to create an animation about a scenery with timelapse animation form morning to night.

In this concept, the main focus is on using lighting and shadowing techniques to add dimension and depth to the timelapse animation. The transition from morning to night will result in variations in light intensity and shadow movement, which will enhance the overall atmosphere of the scene. 

Additional animations, such as wind, moving clouds, birds, insects, and wind-blowing effects, will add dynamic elements, making the scene more lively and realistic. At night, the addition of the moon and stars will create a realistic night sky, with soft lighting from the moon and twinkling stars in the background. The moon and stars can also shift position or change in light intensity as time progresses, creating the impression of continuous time flow.

For the interactive features, technologies like Unity and map magic, allowing users to interact with the scene by moving objects, manipulating clouds or manipulating the stars in the sky. Interactive buttons can also be used to trigger certain animations, such as initiating wind gusts or adjusting the speed of the time transition.

# Graphical Focus
Each object in the scene like trees, rocks, and clouds will interact directly with the main light source, the sun. _Real-time physics-based rendering_ (PBR) techniques will ensure that materials reflect and absorb light appropriately, contributing to the scene's realism. The interplay between light and objects will create dynamic shifts in both direct and ambient light, influencing how each object is perceived during the time lapse.

# Reference for Project Implementation

  The scene that we are aiming to create is inspired by the change of lighting and shadow shown by the video below:

  As you can see, the transition from daytime to nighttime will result in a gradual shift in the lighting conditions, affecting surrounding object's shadow and illumination. 

# Technologies Used
  The development of this project leverages state-of-the-art technologies to ensure optimal performance and maintainability. Some of the key technologies utilized include:

  1. Unity 3D
  - Unity will be the main tool in which this project going to be worked on. We use Unity 3D mainly because it's free, also there are many free assets in their assets store that could help us to develop this project in terms of quality and time efficiency.

  2. Map Magic 2
  - [Map Magic 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/mapmagic-2-165180#description) is a free Unity asset that has the ability to generate a whole island only by a few clicks. The main feature is that it uses a graph and nodes workflow to create a terrain. Each node on a graph represents a terrain or object generator: noise, voronoi, blend, curve, erosion, etc. Once the nodes are connected, the magic happens: a game map will be created without any human involvement.

  These tools were selected based on their availability, simplicity, and ability to support the required graphical and functional features of the project.


# Optional Features

  The following features are planned for implementation, but will only be prioritized if there is sufficient time within the project schedule:

  1. Implementation of wind
     -  A button that will create a wind effect that affects surrounding objects
  2. Flashlight button
     - A button that turns user's mouse into a light source that will interact with surrounding objects
