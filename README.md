# Reference for Project Implementation

  The scene that we are aiming to create is inspired by the change of lighting and shadow shown by the video below:

  <video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="./assets/Final Project Overview/overview.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

  As you can see, the transition from daytime to nighttime will result in a gradual shift in the lighting conditions, affecting surrounding object's shadow and illumination. 

# Technologies Used
  The development of this project leverages state-of-the-art technologies to ensure optimal performance and maintainability. Some of the key technologies utilized include:

  1. Unity 3D
  Unity will be the main tool in which this project going to be worked on. We use Unity 3D mainly because it's free, also there are many free assets in their assets store that could help us to develop this project in terms of quality and time efficiency.

  2. Map Magic 2
  [Map Magic 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/mapmagic-2-165180#description) is a free Unity asset that has the ability to generate a whole island only by a few clicks. The main feature is that it uses a graph and nodes workflow to create a terrain. Each node on a graph represents a terrain or object generator: noise, voronoi, blend, curve, erosion, etc. Once the nodes are connected, the magic happens: a game map will be created without any human involvement.

  These tools were selected based on their availability, simplicity, and ability to support the required graphical and functional features of the project.


# Optional Features

  The following features are planned for implementation, but will only be prioritized if there is sufficient time within the project schedule:

  1. Implementation of wind
     -  A button that will create a wind effect that affects surrounding objects
  2. Flashlight button
     - A button that turns user's mouse into a light source that will interact with surrounding objects
